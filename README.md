# rock-paper-scissors

This is a practice exercise from The Odin Project's foundations course:
https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors

It originally consisted of JavaScript logic to play a series of Rock-Paper-Scissors games against a computer opponent in the console.

After doing the [follow-up exercise](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-revisiting-rock-paper-scissors),
it now contains a simple user interface for playing the game on the page.
